# TreasureTime

TreasureTime is a web app designed to help kids build healthy habits around screen time and reading. Each child starts the week with a limited number of “crystals” that they can spend on screen time or earn more of by reading. Saved crystals can be exchanged for pocket money at the end of the week, encouraging responsibility and positive habits.

This project was built as the graduation assignment for the *Women as Web Developers* course at BCS Koolitus (January–February 2025) in a team of two students.
